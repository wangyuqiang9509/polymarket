# 5min BTC Polymarket Skill

Open-source OpenClaw skill for **BTC 5-minute Up/Down** markets on Polymarket.

Repository: https://github.com/Novals83/5min-btc-polymarket

## Strategy (Momentum into Close)
This skill is aligned with a short-horizon momentum strategy:

1. Trade BTC 5m event markets near expiry.
2. Main entry window: around **2 minutes left**.
3. Confirm that BTC has already moved by about **$70-$100** in the active interval.
4. Check market skew (crowd positioning). If flow supports the move direction, enter **with** momentum.
5. Typical sizing: around **50% of trading allocation** (user-defined risk tolerance).
6. Optional micro-hedge when skew is extreme (for example, 95/5): place a small opposite position ($1-$2 equivalent) to reduce tail risk.

This is a momentum-following approach, not a reversal strategy.

## Repository Structure
- `SKILL.md` — skill definition and operating rules
- `config/` — profiles and risk parameters
- `scripts/` — runners/wrappers/hot commands
- `examples/` — practical command examples

## Deploy / Run
### Prerequisites
- OpenClaw environment
- Polymarket execution stack available at:
  - `<your-workspace>/pm-hl-conservative-plus-repo`
- Python virtual env for runner scripts
- Valid API credentials configured outside this repository

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Novals83/5min-btc-polymarket.git
cd 5min-btc-polymarket
```

Read:
- `SKILL.md`
- `config/btc_5m_profiles.yaml`

Run a conservative real test (example):
```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/test_btc_5m_session_exit_sl.py --profile conservative --execute
```

Run aggressive profile:
```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/test_btc_5m_session_exit_sl.py --profile aggressive --execute
```

Unified skill control (recommended):
```bash
scripts/btc5m_ctl.sh start --profile conservative
scripts/btc5m_ctl.sh status
scripts/btc5m_ctl.sh report --limit 20
scripts/btc5m_ctl.sh stop
```

Runtime isolation:
- skill runtime dir: `./runtime`
- auth/env source (default): `<your-workspace>/pm-hl-conservative-plus-repo/.env`
- overrides: `BTC5M_REPO`, `BTC5M_ENV_FILE`, `BTC5M_RUNNER`
- completion auto-report cron (topic 184): `btc5m-completion-autoreport-topic184`

Optional Docker isolation:
```bash
scripts/btc5m_docker.sh up
scripts/btc5m_docker.sh status
scripts/btc5m_docker.sh down
```

## Execution Checklist (Before Live Trade)
Use this quick pre-flight checklist before any real order:

1. **Market validity**
   - Confirm the BTC 5m market is active and not about to close unexpectedly.
2. **Time-to-close window**
   - Prefer entries around ~120 seconds left (90-150s window). Skip earlier and later.
3. **Impulse confirmation**
   - Confirm the observed BTC move is meaningful (strategy reference: ~$70-$100).
4. **Skew confirmation**
   - Verify market skew supports the intended direction (do not fade strong momentum by default).
5. **Liquidity/spread checks**
   - Ensure spread and top-of-book notional pass your minimum thresholds.
6. **Sizing guardrails**
   - Validate stake, max notional, and daily loss limits before execution.
7. **Stop / exit controls**
   - Confirm CLOB 25% stop, 45s flatten of live non-winners, and 20s hold-or-sell.
8. **Execution mode**
   - Start in dry-run when changing parameters; switch to `--execute` only after validation.

## Risk Controls Template
Suggested baseline controls (adapt to your risk profile):

- **Per-trade risk cap**: 1%-15% of account equity (profile dependent)
- **Daily max loss**: hard stop at 10%-15%
- **Max trades/day**: fixed ceiling to avoid overtrading
- **Max notional/trade**: strict upper bound
- **Quote staleness guard**: skip if market data is stale
- **Spread guard**: skip when spread exceeds threshold
- **Liquidity guard**: skip when top ask/bid notional is too thin
- **Extreme skew hedge**: optional small opposite hedge in 95/5-type scenarios
- **Operational kill switch**: immediate stop on repeated API/DNS/execution failures
